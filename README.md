## Description 
I have created an application that deploys a calendar that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Installation
Clone the repo, and run the files in browser. 

## Usage 
If you have a busy schedule, and want to add important events to a daily planner so you can manage your time effectively, this app is for you.  When you open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top.  You can view time blocks for standard business hours.  The time blocks are color coded with past times (gray), present time (red), and future times (green). You can click a time block and type your event for that time.  Click the save icon in the blue box.  Your event is saved in local storage.  If you refresh the page, the saved events persist.
